# Week In Review #2
*01 Dec 2017*

Welcome to the second edition of *Week In Review* for the [Nimiq blockchain project](https://nimiq.com).

> This article is fan-created and has no official connection to the Nimiq developer team or the Nimiq Foundation. As such this article is not able to talk about inner workings of the team, coding in private repositories or plans for the future.

With these *Week In Review* articles I hope to bring regular updates of what is happening publicly in the Nimiq blockchain project to the community. This includes a summary of general news and updates from the team, updates on what is being worked on in the public [Github repository](https://github.com/nimiq-network/core) and information about community projects that are worth pointing out.
