# Week In Review #3
*08 Dec 2017*

Welcome to the third edition of *Week In Review* for the [Nimiq blockchain project](https://nimiq.com).

## Nimiq News
* The Luna testnet was updated with bug fixes and new features - Robin detailed the changes here: [Luna Protocol Update 1](https://medium.com/nimiq-network/luna-protocol-update-1-91f16db62f57)
* A vlog of the team arriving back in Costa Rica was posted to the Youtube channel: [Around The World & Back, CR HQ - Vlog 38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE17LVmHehY)

* Robin posted a blog article explaining their choice of identicon for the Nimiq addresses: [Design Blog 2: Identicons](https://medium.com/nimiq-network/devblog-2-identicons-be50dca91d55)

## Code Updates
The first testnet update fixed a lot of problems with including and ordering transactions in blocks. Now the team is again hard at work preparing the next update:
* Marvin implemented generic transactions types to make way for multi-signature wallets and transactions and eventually time-locked contracts (for payment channels, aka. Bitcoins *Lighting Network*)
* Based off of Marvin's new transaction base class, Pascal is working on multi-signature transactions (based on the Collective-Schnorr algorithm)
* Jeff improved the test suite by fixing some problems and adding new tests for the accounts proof
* The README in the master branch got updated to include better instructions for compiling the code yourself: [Quickstart](https://github.com/nimiq-network/core/blob/master/README.md#quickstart)

## Community Projects
* The block explorer [NIMIQ.WATCH](https://nimiq.watch) received an update that enables the viewing of an account's history: both sent and received transactions and mined blocks

That's all for now. See you [next week](https://nimiq.watch/news/2017-12-17-week-in-review-4.html)!

### *About this newsletter*

With these *Week In Review* articles I hope to bring regular updates of what is publicly happening in the Nimiq blockchain project to the community. This includes a summary of general news and updates from the team, updates on what is being worked on in the public [Github repository](https://github.com/nimiq-network/core) and information about community projects that are worth pointing out.
